    <p>My audience is homeowners who have extra space that they donâ€™t know what to do with. I chose this audience
         because they are more likely to give the space in their house to refugees who need it. They may be older
          people whose children are all grown up and out of the house or people who just have a spare bedroom that
           they want to bless someone with. This could also be targeted towards more religious people as they could
            feel that helping people in need is the calling of their religion. My strategy to convince my audience 
            to help out is to point out that they have space and that some people, maybe themselves included, rent 
            that space for strangers. This can also be done through statistics of homeless refugees in the United 
            States. I can also point out that refugees only have one to three months of rent free living before they
             have to start paying for their own rent. </p>
